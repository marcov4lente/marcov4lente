# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

    # The default document collection to paginate if nothing is specified ('posts' is default)
    collection: 'posts'

    # How many objects per paginated page, used to be `paginate` (default: 0, means all)
    per_page: 5

    # The permalink structure for the paginated pages (this can be any level deep)
    permalink: '/page/:num/' # Pages are index.html inside this folder (default)
    #permalink: '/page/:num.html' # Pages are simple html files
    #permalink: '/page/:num' # Pages are html files, linked jekyll extensionless permalink style.

    # Optional the title format for the paginated pages (supports :title for original page title, :num for pagination page number, :max for total number of pages)

    category: 'posts'

    # Optional, the default tag to use, omit to disable
    tag: ''

    locale: ''
